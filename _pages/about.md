About
======
#I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, studying international relations (IR) with a minor in political methodology. My research broadly focuses on the intersection of security and non-state actors. My security research often focuses on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping and evaluating how, when, and where peacekeepers effectively protect civilians. For example, my dissertation, tentatively titled, *The Local Effects of UN Peacekeeping*, examines the effects peacekeepers have on saving civilian lives and preventing violence against civilians with advanced quantitative methods at the most granular level used in the peacekeeping effectiveness literature.

#My research also encompasses other non-state security actors, such as private military and security contractors (PMSCs). In my research on the UN's use of private security contractors (PSCs), for example, I first construct a novel database to expand our descriptive understanding of what we know about how the UN uses PSCs. Next, I built the concept of double delegation of authority, which borrows ideas and structures from the sociology literature on symbols, the principal-agent literature on delegation costs, and the sovereignty literature on authority.

#I am always open to collaborative research projects and am currently working on several projects with other graduate students and professors. My most recent research on PMSCs focuses on non-traditional actors, such as Russia's use of the [Wagner Group](https://www.csis.org/blogs/post-soviet-post/band-brothers-wagner-group-and-russian-state), which I am working on with [Matthew Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-ellis-7b187492/). I'm also working on a peacekeeping project with professors [Zach Warner](https://zachwarner.net/) and [Doug Atkinson](https://dougbatkinson.wordpress.com/), examining when violence fills the vacuum left when peacekeepers depart. Finally, I'm working on a research project with [Catalina Vega-MÃ©ndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalina-vega-mendez-9947a01b9/), where we investigate the effects of peacekeepers as a mediating variable on the perception of migrants.

Short Biography
======
#Before starting my Ph.D. program at Purdue, I received my BA from Purdue in 2019. I grew up in Indianapolis, IN, and started my undergraduate studies in 2015 in political science. I initially started grad school to advance my expertise in IR to a Master's level. However, collaborations with fellow graduate students and professors alongside rigorous training in methodology fostered an affinity for all things research, leading me to pursue academia as a career. I am a first-gen queer scholar seeking to improve the lives and experiences of those marginalized by academia and the broader world, especially minority and first-gen grad students who often face barriers invisible to others.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
